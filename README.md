This project consist in a dice roller, where you can choose between the dice with 4,6,8,10,12,20 sides.
The button with the green LED choose the die and the button with the red LED rolls it.
To represent the numbers greater than 10 in the 7-segment display, we used the dot to represent '+10'. With the exception of 10, that is represented by the number 0, and 20 that is 0 dot.
So 1 to 9 is simple, and 10 is 0, 11 is dot, 12 is 2dot, and so on until 20 which is 0dot.
